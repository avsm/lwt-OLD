(** Main loop and event queue *)

(** This module controls the ``main-loop'' of Lwt. *)

val run : 'a Lwt.t -> 'a
  (** [run t] calls the Lwt scheduler repeatedly until [t] terminates,
      then returns the value returned by the thread. It [t] fails with
      an exception, this exception is raised.

      Note that you should avoid using [run] inside threads
      - The calling threads will not resume before [run]
        returns.
      - Successive invocations of [run] are serialized: an
        invocation of [run] will not terminate before all
        subsequent invocations are terminated. *)

val exit_hooks : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt_sequence.t
  (** Sets of functions executed just before the program exit.

      Notes:
      - each hook is called exactly one time
      - exceptions raised by hooks are ignored *)

val fast_yield : unit -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [fast_yield ()] is similar to {!Lwt_unix.yield} except that it
      resume earlier. It resumes before entering the main loop. *)

(** {6 Low-level control of event loop} *)

(** The rest of this file is for advanced users. You must have a good
    understanding on how Lwt works to use it.

    This part has two purpose:
    - integration of external libraries which are not ``Lwt-aware''
      but are ``main-loop'' aware, or more generally which support
      asynchronous IOs.
    - replace the default main-loop implementation (which is just
      a wrapper around select) by another one.
*)

val wakeup_fast_sleepers : unit -> unit
  (** [wakeup_fast_sleepers ()] wakeups all threads that have suspend
      themselves with {!fast_yield}. This function must be called
      before collecting any sources. *)

type fd_set = Unix.file_descr list
    (** A set of file-descriptors *)

type current_time = float Lazy.t
    (** The current time. It is a lazy value to avoid a call to
        [Unix.gettimeofday] if not needed. *)

type select = fd_set -> fd_set -> fd_set -> float option -> current_time * fd_set * fd_set * fd_set
  (** Type of a select-like function *)

val select_filters : (current_time -> select -> select) Lwt_sequence.t
  (** The set of all select filters. *)

val apply_filters : select -> select
  (** [apply_filters select] apply all the filters on the given select
      function. *)

val default_select : select
  (** The default select function. It uses [Unix.select]. *)

val default_iteration : unit -> unit
  (** The default iteration function. It just apply all select filters
      on [default_select], the, call the resulting select function. *)

val main_loop_iteration : (unit -> unit) ref
  (** The function doing one step of the main loop. *)

(** {6 Utils} *)

val min_timeout : float option -> float option -> float option
  (** [min_timeout a b] returns the smallest timeout of two
      timeouts. *)
